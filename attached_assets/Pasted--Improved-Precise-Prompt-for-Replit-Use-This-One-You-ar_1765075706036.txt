⭐ Improved, Precise Prompt for Replit (Use This One)

You are updating the personal website for Daniel Araujo.
Make the following changes exactly as specified:

1. Profile Picture (Hero Section)

Increase the size of the circular profile image.

Zoom the picture slightly so Daniel’s face occupies more of the circle.

Ensure image quality stays crisp.

Keep the layout balanced on desktop and mobile.

2. "My Foundation" Card (Photo of Daniel & Hannah)

Improve this card in three ways:

A. Text Contrast

Increase contrast so the title and text are easy to read over the background image.

You may use:

A dark gradient overlay

A semi-transparent dark panel behind the text

Cleaner font color (white or light tones)

B. Content Rewrite (50 Words)

Replace the body text with a short paragraph focused on:

Daniel’s relationship with Hannah, his wife

His faith and religion

How both shape his values and character

Keep the tone humble, sincere, not flashy

(You must write the new ~50-word paragraph.)

C. Improve visual polish

Make the layout feel warmer and more personal without distracting effects.

3. Tone Adjustments Across the Site

Remove or rewrite anything that sounds overconfident or exaggerated.

Avoid phrases like:

“Building the future with purpose”

“Visionary”

“I build solutions”

Replace with grounded, humble, professional descriptions.

Tone target:

Honest

Hard-working

Down-to-earth

Focused on learning, service, growth

No bragging

4. Gallup Strengths Section

Improve layout and visual balance.

Requirements:

Display official Gallup CliftonStrengths logos or badges (use license-free versions if available).

Align the strengths cleanly in a grid or two-column layout so spacing is even on desktop and mobile.

Typography should match the branding tone used by Gallup (clean, straightforward).

5. BYU Branding

Add official BYU branding elements:

Use an official BYU logo (find a license-free SVG/PNG version such as the BYU wordmark).

Place it in the Education section and anywhere else appropriate.

Keep it subtle and professional.

6. Themes App Section

Update this section so it visually matches the real Themes app vibe.

Requirements:

Use the actual Themes app icon as the main graphic.

Adjust colors to match the app’s palette (same gradient, tones, or minimalist style used in the app UI).

Clean, modern, soft design.

A short description focused on:

What the app does

Why Daniel created it

Keep tone humble (not “visionary”).

7. Professional Timeline Section (Dynamic Earth Background)

Transform the timeline section into a more modern, immersive experience:

Visual Requirements

Replace the current background with a dark, dynamic Earth globe animation.

As the user scrolls down the timeline:

The globe moves/rotates

It zooms in slightly on the geographic region where the job occurred

Example: Brazil → Utah → Florida → etc.

A subtle Google-Earth-from-space aesthetic

Should not distract from the text, but enhance context.

Technical Guidance

You may use:

A lightweight JavaScript globe library (e.g. three.js, three-globe, EarthJS)

Or a looping video background if performance is an issue

Keep performance high: smooth scrolling, no lag

8. Ask Before Assuming

If any image assets are needed (e.g., Themes app logo, BYU logo, Gallup badge), ask me to upload them or provide links.

9. Overall Style Consistency

Make sure:

All pages stay consistent in typography, spacing, and palette.

The profile image sizing changes do not break mobile layout.

The tone throughout is humble, balanced, and professional.
