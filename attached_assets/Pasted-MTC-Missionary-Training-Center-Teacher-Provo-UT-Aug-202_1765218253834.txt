MTC (Missionary Training Center)

Teacher • Provo, UT • Aug 2024 – Present

Expanded description:
At the MTC, I work directly with new missionaries as they learn Portuguese and prepare for full-time service. A big part of my role is creating an environment where they feel safe to practice, make mistakes, and grow. I adapt lessons to different personalities, learning speeds, and confidence levels, helping them develop both their language ability and their teaching skills. I also collaborate with other instructors to refine lesson plans and improve the overall training process. Teaching here has strengthened my patience, communication, and ability to explain complex ideas in simple, practical ways.

Hawx Services

Sales Representative • Orlando, FL • Apr 2024 – Jul 2024

Expanded description:
My time at Hawx pushed me out of my comfort zone and taught me how to communicate clearly with people from all backgrounds. I talked with homeowners face-to-face, learned to listen to their concerns, and explained solutions in a straightforward and honest way. The work was demanding—walking long hours in the Florida heat and dealing with rejection daily—but it helped me develop resilience, empathy, and confidence. It also taught me how to understand customer needs quickly and offer options that made sense for them.

AWR Franchising

Traffic Manager • Joinville, Brazil • Jul 2022 – Sep 2023

Expanded description:
At AWR, I managed digital advertising campaigns for a large portfolio of franchise clients. Each account had different goals, budgets, and challenges, so I spent a lot of time analyzing results, adjusting strategies, and communicating recommendations in a way that made sense to business owners. I built internal workflows to help organize projects and ensure consistency across the team, and I helped train newer traffic managers as they learned the platform. This role taught me how to manage many priorities at once, interpret performance data, and support clients who depended on marketing to keep their businesses running.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints

Volunteer Representative • São Paulo, Brazil • Jun 2020 – Jun 2022

Expanded description:
Serving in São Paulo was one of the most meaningful experiences of my life. I taught lessons, offered service, and supported individuals and families throughout the community. I also had leadership responsibilities, helping oversee the schedules, training, and well-being of more than 120 missionaries. That meant planning meetings, setting goals, resolving challenges, and making sure everyone had what they needed to do their work. I learned how to lead with compassion, stay organized under pressure, and work with people facing very different situations and backgrounds.

Boson Store

Business Owner • Joinville, Brazil • Jan 2019 – Feb 2020

Expanded description:
I started Boson Store when I was still a teenager, and it became my first real experience running a business. I built the online store on Shopify, sourced products, handled payments, shipments, returns, and customer service, and managed all the marketing. The store grew quickly, reaching significant revenue and giving me firsthand exposure to budgeting, logistics, and market demand. It taught me how to solve problems on the fly, listen to customers, and make decisions with limited information. Even though it was challenging, it’s where I discovered how much I enjoy business, analytics, and entrepreneurship.
